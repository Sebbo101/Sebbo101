# My Personal GitHub Repository!

Welcome to my personal GitHub repository! My name is Seb and I am from the Netherlands.

I just started my coding journey and I aim to learn different languages. I am currently following beginner python courses on [Datacamp.com](https://app.datacamp.com/)
Feel free to reach out to me in any way shape or form. See you around!

Kind regards,

Seb
